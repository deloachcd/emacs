* emacs
  [[./res/img/capture.png]]
This repository hosts my emacs config, which is best deployed in a unix-like environment with my [[https://github.com/deloachcd/portapotty][Portapotty]] script
 
** Dependencies
- ~libgccjit~ (if compiling with recommended nativecomp)
*** for vterm
- ~cmake~
- ~libtool-bin~
- ~libvterm~ (apparently optional, but I haven't tried without it)
*** for python layer
- ~black~

** What kind of emac is this?
This emac is Yet Another Evil Mode Setupâ„¢ which takes a lot of ideas (and steals a lot of elisp code) from [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom emacs]]. It leverages trendy cool kid plugins like [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]], [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]] and [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] for what I think is a solid editing experience that's not too complicated to personalize. It also leverages [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/NEWS?id=6dfdf0c9e8e4aca77b148db8d009c862389c64d3][package-quickstart]] and makes no attempt to support anything below emacs 27 (I also prefer to compile with nativecomp support, so ~libgccjit~ is an optional dependency).

** How the init file is organized
Much like doom and [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]], the bulk of configuration is divided into (mostly) self-contained layers. These layers are located in ~init-layers~ and are loaded in the order they are listed in ~init.el~ (again, much like how doom emacs does it). There is an attempt to keep dependencies to a minimum, but there are exceptions to that made on a case-by-case basis. Two major exceptions are that pretty much everything can be expected to ~require~ the ~general-keybinds~ layer, as it's used for many layers to set their own ~SPC~ bindings (more on that later), and the ~flycheck~ layer is used for language-specific layers to hook in syntax checking.

** How keybindings are organized
Keybindings can be broken down into two types, each accessed with a different global prefix key:
- ~SPC~ bindings
- ~<comma>~ bindings
~SPC~ bindings work exactly like they do in spacemacs/doom, but here are only defined for global bindings that switch modes, switch files, change windows, load pop-up buffers, etc. Whatever they do, it should make sense to do it regardless of the major mode of the buffer they're called from.

~<comma>~ bindings cover everything that it would be cumbersome/unwieldy to define ~SPC~ bindings for, and do so by activating ~god-mode~ for a single keychord so that keybindings defined using the default scheme can be accessed in a modal fashion. This allows for access to bindings that many major modes include by default (for example, all the bindings that ~org-mode~ includes) in a way that appeals to people allergic to default emacs's heavy use of modifier keys. Basically, if it's a built-in or it only makes sense to do it in a specfic type of buffer or major mode, it should be defined for that mode using the default emacs scheme and accessed via ~god-mode~ through the ~<comma>~ prefix.

As far as I know, this distinction between ~SPC~ and ~<comma>~ bindings is one of the major ways this emac seeks to diverge from the way spacemacs and doom do things, and bring things closer to the emacs defaults in a way that doesn't involve quite so much heavy usage of modifier keys (and without needing foot pedals).

** Navigating the editor's keybindings
This config uses [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] to provide a nice pop-up list of labelled prefixes and bindings for keychords as you type them. Paging does not work reliably in the minibuffer, though, so if there are so many options that you can't read them all in the pop-up (for example, the many built-in bindings for ~org-mode~) you can type ~C-h~ after the prefix you're using to get a full list of keybindings available for it in the current major mode (as far as I know, this is the only time you really need to use a modifier key with this config).
