  This repository hosts my emacs config, which is best deployed in a Linux environment with my [[https://github.com/deloachcd/portapotty][Portapotty]]
  script.
  
** Mnemonic bindings
   This config uses a [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]]-based scheme of mnemoic bindings associated with configuration layers
   that I essentially ripped off from [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]].
   
   | SPC- binding | Mnemonic   | Configuration layer (in init-layers) |
   |--------------+------------+--------------------------------------|
   | e            | eval-elisp | general-keybinds-layer               |
   | b            | buffers    | general-keybinds-layer               |
   | f            | files      | general-keybinds-layer               |
   | h            | help       | general-keybinds-layer               |
   | s            | shell      | general-keybinds-layer               |
   | w            | window     | general-keybinds-layer               |
   | p            | projectile | projectile-layer                     |
   | o            | org-mode   | org-layer                            |
   | g            | git        | magit-layer                          |
   | l            | languages  | ide-layer                            |

   The "languages" binding ~SPC-l~ has its own set of prefixes:
   | Prefix | Language |
   |--------+----------|
   | b      | bash     |
   | p      | python   |
   | r      | ruby     |
   | c      | C        |
   | +      | C++      |
